🌟 **Phase 5 – Calibration, Debugging & Field Reliability Enhancements**

**Refining the System for Accurate, Stable, and Real-World-Ready Performance**

---

### **1. 🎯 Phase Objective**

Phase 5 focused on fine-tuning the entire system to ensure accuracy, stability, and consistent performance under different conditions. This phase polished the autonomous system into a **reliable, field-ready prototype**.

---

### **2. 🔧 Sensor Calibration**

- **LDR/Photodiode Calibration:**

Adjusted sensitivity for different lighting conditions—bright light, indoor shade, and slight glare.

Ensured accurate left/right deviation detection without noise or false triggers.

- **Ultrasonic / IR Calibration:**

Refined distance thresholds to ensure precise STOP indication at the correct forward range.

Adjusted response for slow, fast, and uneven approach speeds.

### **3. 🐞 Debugging & Optimization**

- Removed fluctuations caused by ambient light noise.

• Improved filtering of sensor readings for stability.

• Ensured microcontroller timing loops were smooth and flicker-free.

• Fixed display update delays to maintain real-time responsiveness.

• Strengthened logic transitions between signals such as FORWARD → SLOW → STOP.

### **4. 🧪 Field Reliability Testing**

Real-world testing was performed to validate:

- Movement accuracy at different angles

• Stable detection under varying light conditions

• Reliability of STOP threshold

• Smooth UI updates without lag

• Consistent behavior after repeated trials

These tests demonstrated that the system performs reliably in practical demonstration scenarios.

### **5. 🚀 Final Outcome of Phase 5**

By the end of Phase 5:

- The system became **accurate, consistent, and stable**

• All sensors were fully calibrated for real-world operation

• Firmware was optimized for reliable autonomous guidance

• The display delivered clear and immediate marshalling signals

• The prototype reached a **presentable, demo-ready quality** suitable for hackathons, labs, and training centers
